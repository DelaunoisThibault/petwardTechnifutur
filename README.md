# <samp>OVERVIEW</samp>

Petwards is a powerful API for managing Petwards, shelter for fantastic beasts like nifflers, hippogriffs, and dragons.
Built with Spring and a three-tier architecture, it streamlines shelter management, beast creation, and adoption, along with advanced filtering capabilities, all through distinct layers for presentation, business logic, and data access.
Developed as a group project, it was built by [clawyn](https://github.com/clawyn), [olankens](https://github.com/olankens), and [titou](https://github.com/DelaunoisThibault).
